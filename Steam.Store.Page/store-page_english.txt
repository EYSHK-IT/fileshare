ShareX has an advanced hotkey system which allows you to use any of these capture methods, upload options or tools with their own task settings. These are called "Workflows". Workflows allow each hotkey to have its own after capture tasks, after upload tasks, destination etc. For example, you can set your screen recording hotkey to upload to a specific destination, bypassing the default destination. This way, only videos will be uploaded to this configured file destination.
